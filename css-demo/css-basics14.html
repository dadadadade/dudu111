			<h2>Project Introduction</h2>
			<p>As millennials who have lived in the city since childhood, steel and concrete are built into forests, and residential buildings are connected into waves. We have lost the original sense of belonging to nature. We are a generation alienated by the Internet. The grotesque information world has shaped our definition of "reality" and "truth", but we have turned a blind eye to the real and happening life. It wasn't until a certain moment that we suddenly realized that life is not elsewhere, but life is around us. It turns out that our heartbeat has long been integrated into the changing frequency of the city, but we are submerged in those emotions of loneliness, confusion, and anxiety... I hope this book can take you to experience the unique romantic atmosphere of the city again. </p>
